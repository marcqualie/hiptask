## Hiptask

A hipster command line task applicaiton for me to put my newly learn ruby skills to practical use.

### Usage

    hiptask # prints help
    hiptask list # displays your task list
    hiptask add CONTENT # adds a new task
    hiptask do ID # marks a task as complete
    hiptask undo ID # reverts task to normal
    hiptask update ID CONTENT # update task content
    hiptask delete ID # deletes a task forever

### Feedback

I do realise this code won't be the best as it's very my first ruby project. However, I will apreciate any feedback you can give me on the project or my Ruby skills in general.
